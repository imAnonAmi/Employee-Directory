Also I would like to acknowledge Kristofer Giltvedt Selbekk's fantastic article 'Creating Sortable Tables With React', which helped contextualize a lot of this and showed how to use Hooks as a means of execution. https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/sortable-tables-react/. Reading this article prompted me to rework assignment, so it seems right to acknowledge that debt.

## Tests

N/A

## Questions and Further Areas for Development
Rewrite this using Contexts so that I can drill deeper into the passed object, and make the Directory sortable on all fields.
